### TALK TITLE:

Extending Shiny by Enhancing User Experience with shinyLP


### ABSTRACT:

'Shiny' has become a popular tool for sharing R code and has sparked the development of additional packages to enhance the functionality for advanced applications. 'shinyLP' was developed to provide functions that wrap HTML Bootstrap components, to enable the design and layout of informative landing home pages for 'shiny' applications. The user experience and interface are important aspects to consider when developing robust applications in order to direct, especially non-technical users, how to use the application efficiently.
