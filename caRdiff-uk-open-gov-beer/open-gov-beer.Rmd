## The search for datasets

- finding *interesting* and *available* datasets is a concern for all those involved in data science.
- Where to look?
    - google
    - github
    - kaggle
    - open government data portals
    - ?

## The search for analysis-ready datasets

- if cleaning data is 70% of the data science process than the desire for analysis-ready data (even at the basic csv format) is priority #1 after addressing the business questions.
- analysis-ready data also needs to include *some* type of documentation

## The US open government data portal

- examples of PDF reports
- examples of the bad and the good

## The reality and struggle

- ... are real

## `ttbbeer`

- An R data package of beer statistics from U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)
    - The plan: liberate more beer statistics datasets from *open U.S. government data portals* to analysis-ready data frames for R and beyond
    - The method: **web-scraping** with `rvest` (the first dataset was copy/pasted to excel due to the limited R ecosystem of PDF parsing pacakges)
    - The dream: increase awareness of beer analytics and promote analysis-ready datasets from [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
    
- available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ttbbeer/index.html) and [Github](https://github.com/jasdumas/ttbbeer)

## Questions & Cheers!
