# Open Government Data and Beer Analytics

This talk will feature a deep dive on the state of analysis-ready data from open data portals from the U.S. Government (data.gov) and beyond in relation to beer statistics and analytics. This talk will share resources and examples on how to navigate open data portals, collecting & web scrapping data from government websites, and advocating for data in usable formats for data scientists (think csv not pdf). Case studies in this talk will utilize popular R packages such as rvest, dplyr, ggplot2, and ttbbeer; a R data package filled with pre-processed beer statistics data from the U.S. Department of Treasury, developed by the speaker Jasmine Dumas.
