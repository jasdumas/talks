# Web-scraping and Visualizing Beer Statistics from Open Government Data Portals

This talk will feature an introduction to the state of analysis-ready data from open data portals from the U.S. Government (data.gov) and beyond in relation to beer statistics and analytics. This talk will share resources on how to navigate open data portals, collecting & web scraping data from government websites, visualizing and advocating for data in usable formats for data scientists (think csv not pdf!). Examples in this talk will utilize popular R packages such as rvest, dplyr, ggplot2, shiny and ttbbeer; a R data package filled with pre-processed beer statistics data from the U.S. Department of Treasury, developed by the speaker Jasmine Dumas.
