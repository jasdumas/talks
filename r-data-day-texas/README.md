## R User Day @ Data Day Texas

A talk presented about **_R, What is it good for? Absolutely Everything_** at AT&T Conference Center at the University of Texas, Austin, TX • January 27 2018

Abstract: Good does not mean great, but good is better than bad. When we try to compare programming languages we tend to look at the surface components (popular developer influence, singular use cases or language development & design choices) and sometimes we forget the substantive (sometimes secondary) components of what can make a programming language appropriate for use, such as: versatility, environment and inclusivity. I’ll highlight each of these themes in the presentation to _show and not tell_ of why R is good for everything!
