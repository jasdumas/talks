## I learned about data science from the internet

## ["A rose by any other name would smell as sweet"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rose_by_any_other_name_would_smell_as_sweet)

- Aside from the buzzword of "Data Science" and the *sought after title* "Data Scientist" people have been involved in this type of work under several different names:
    - Data Mining
    - Datalogy
    - Knowledge Discovery
    - Data Analytics
    - Business Analytics
    - Predictive Analytics
    - Machine Learning
    - Informatics
    - Applied Statistics 
    - more? ...

## Discovering resources can be a challenge

- With many types of resources and approaches available, the decision on *what* to learn and *who* to learn it from can be overwhelming given the lack of consensus in curriculum.
    - 🎓 Graduate/Undergraduate coursework
    - 🆓 Open source coursework
    - 👾 Massively open online coursework (MOOCs)
    - 🔩 Project experience
    - 🏕 Bootcamps
    - 💼 Job experience

## Dipping my toe in the water...

- Before enrolling in an **expensive** graduate school program, I wanted to gain some experience by combining MOOCs and project experience. 
- Some considerations I had when selecting my data science curriculum:
    - low cost or free
    - reputable instructors
    - interactive platform
    - diverse programming approaches
    - applied projects for a portfolio
