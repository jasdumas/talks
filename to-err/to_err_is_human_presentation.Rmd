# Intended audience
- This presentation is intended for beginners to the R language and environment
- Those who want to overcome fears of decoding messages 
- Those who want to build portable skills to asses their code and minimize downtime due to R's *sometimes* confusing & cryptic errors.

<h1 align="center" style="color:#FA8072;"> Introduction </h1>

# Everyone makes mistakes
- Errors (and their messages) happen to everyone, even experienced programmers.
- Learning how to solve and interpret errors will help us to write efficient and elegant code. 
- Developing skills to cope with the frustration of error message will make for a more enjoyable time crafting programs.

# B.R.I.E Method ðŸ§€
- First steps in confidently approaching error messages is by following the B.R.I.E Method
    - <font color = "green">**B**</font>reathe and relax your mind
    - <font color = "green">**R**</font>e-read the error message and focus on key wording
    - <font color = "green">**I**</font>solate the <font color = "green">**E**</font>rror within your code to reduce complexity
- Hopefully this method can act as a guide to approaching and solving errors in your R code (and other programming languages as well!)

<h1 align="center" style="color:#FA8072;"> Common Sources of Error Messages </h1>

# Data types & structures
- Many error messages start from applying the wrong method or function with a data structures.
- R base has **5** common data structures: 
    - Atomic Vector: *logical, integer, double (often called numeric), and character.*
    - Matrix
    - Array
    - List
    - Data Frame
    
# Error #1: non-numeric argument to binary operator
```{r}
name_string = "Jasmine"
name_string * 2
```
- To decode this error the key statement is <font color = "red">'binary operator'</font>. Multiplication requires *two* numeric values around the * symbol.
- This error informs the user that one of the values supplied to the multiplication recipe is not a number!
- Note: A unary operator is a `+` (positive) or `-` (negative) in-front of a number.

# Error #2: invalid 'type' (character) of argument
```{r}
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "hello world")
sum(vec)
```
- This error states that the character <font color = "red">'type'</font> cannot be included in the aggregate function `sum()`. Only numeric or integer values can be summed.
- Once again this is a improper mixing of data types numeric and characters.

# Data wrangling 
- Data wrangling and cleaning can take the majority of time in the data science workflow.
- Many type of errors can arise when subsetting and manipulating multi-dimensional data objects.
- With different types of packages it can be common to get flustered by confusing errors that can be function specific such as requiring an input argument to be a list instead of a data frame

# Error #3: all arguments must have the same length
```{r}
df <- data.frame("age" = c(32, 31, 34), 
                 "pet" = c(F, T, T), 
                 "name" = c("Adam", "Blake", "Anders"))
table(df$age, df$pets)
```
- The error describes that the two supplied arguments to `table()` are not the same length which is required for cross tabulation. The spelling mistake (*pet versus pets*) actually has a length of **0** which is a mismatch from df$age which has a length **3** but the error message does not indicate that the column name was **misspelled.**
